The view will then take\n// care to call `preventDefault` on the event, except with\n// `handleDOMEvents`, where the handler itself is responsible for that.\n//\n// How a prop is resolved depends on the prop. Handler functions are\n// called one at a time, starting with the base props and then\n// searching through the plugins (in order of appearance) until one of\n// them returns true. For some props, the first plugin that yields a\n// value gets precedence.\n//\n//   handleDOMEvents:: ?Object<(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event) → bool>\n//   Can be an object mapping DOM event type names to functions that\n//   handle them. Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied. If it returns `true`, the default\n//   behavior of actually inserting the text is suppressed.\n//\n//   handleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a click, from the inside out. The\n//   `direct` flag will be true for the inner node.\n//\n//   handleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is clicked, after `handleClickOn` handlers\n//   have been called.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a double click.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is double-clicked, after `handleDoubleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handleTripleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a triple click.\n//\n//   handleTripleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is triple-clicked, after `handleTripleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handlePaste:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.ClipboardEvent, slice: Slice) → bool\n//   Can be used to override the behavior of pasting. `slice` is the\n//   pasted content parsed by the editor, but you can directly access\n//   the event to get at the raw content.\n//\n//   handleDrop:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event, slice: Slice, moved: bool) → bool\n//   Called when something is dropped on the editor. `moved` will be\n//   true if this drop moves from the current selection (which should\n//   thus be deleted).\n//\n//   handleScrollToSelection:: ?(view: EditorView) → bool\n//   Called when the view, after updating its state, tries to scroll\n//   the selection into view. A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM. Defaults to calling\n//   [`DOMParser.fromSchema`](#model.DOMParser^fromSchema) on the\n//   editor's schema.\n//\n//   transformPastedHTML:: ?(html: string) → string\n//   Can be used to transform pasted HTML text, _before_ it is parsed,\n//   for example to clean it up.\n//\n//   clipboardParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading content from\n//   the clipboard. When not given, the value of the\n//   [`domParser`](#view.EditorProps.domParser) prop is used.\n//\n//   transformPastedText:: ?(text: string, plain: bool) → string\n//   Transform pasted plain text. The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice. Called after\n//   [`transformPastedText`](#view.EditorProps.transformPastedText).\n//   The default behavior is to split the text into lines, wrap them\n//   in `<p>` tags, and call\n//   [`clipboardParser`](#view.EditorProps.clipboardParser) on it.\n//   The `plain` flag will be true when the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   transformPasted:: ?(Slice) → Slice\n//   Can be used to transform pasted content before it is applied to\n//   the document.\n//\n//   nodeViews:: ?Object<(node: Node, view: EditorView, getPos: () → number, decorations: [Decoration], innerDecorations: DecorationSource) → NodeView>\n//   Allows you to pass custom rendering and behavior logic for nodes\n//   and marks. Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   `innerDecorations` holds the decorations for the node's content.\n//   You can safely ignore this if your view has no content or a\n//   `contentDOM` property, since the editor will draw the decorations\n//   on the content. But if you, for example, want to create a nested\n//   editor with the content, it may make sense to provide it with the\n//   inner decorations.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSource\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view. Defaults to 5.\n\n// DirectEditorProps:: interface extends EditorProps\n//\n// The props object given directly to the editor view supports two\n// fields that can't be used in plugins:\n//\n//   state:: EditorState\n//   The current state of the editor.\n//\n//   dispatchTransaction:: ?(tr: Transaction)\n//   The callback over which to send transactions (state updates)\n//   produced by the view. If you specify this, you probably want to\n//   make sure this ends up calling the view's\n//   [`updateState`](#view.EditorView.updateState) method with a new\n//   state that has the transaction\n//   [applied](#state.EditorState.apply). The callback will be bound to have\n//   the view instance as its `this` binding.\n\nexport { Decoration, DecorationSet, EditorView, endComposition as __endComposition, parseFromClipboard as __parseFromClipboard, serializeForClipboard as __serializeForClipboard };\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.es.js.map\n","var isSymbol = require('../internals/is-symbol');\n\nmodule.exports = function (argument) {\n  if (isSymbol(argument)) throw TypeError('Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string');\n  return String(argument);\n};\n","import { Mark, mergeAttributes, getMarkAttributes } from '@tiptap/core';\n\nconst TextStyle = Mark.create({\r\n    name: 'textStyle',\r\n    defaultOptions: {\r\n        HTMLAttributes: {},\r\n    },\r\n    parseHTML() {\r\n        return [\r\n            {\r\n                tag: 'span',\r\n                getAttrs: element => {\r\n                    const hasStyles = element.hasAttribute('style');\r\n                    if (!hasStyles) {\r\n                        return false;\r\n                    }\r\n                    return {};\r\n                },\r\n            },\r\n        ];\r\n    },\r\n    renderHTML({ HTMLAttributes }) {\r\n        return ['span', mergeAttributes(this.options.HTMLAttributes, HTMLAttributes), 0];\r\n    },\r\n    addCommands() {\r\n        return {\r\n            removeEmptyTextStyle: () => ({ state, commands }) => {\r\n                const attributes = getMarkAttributes(state, this.type);\r\n                const hasStyles = Object.entries(attributes).some(([, value]) => !!value);\r\n                if (hasStyles) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }\r\n                return commands.unsetMark('textStyle');\r\n            },\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n});\n\nexport default TextStyle;\nexport { TextStyle };\n//# sourceMappingURL=tiptap-extension-text-style.esm.js.map\n","module.exports = function (bitmap, value) {\n  return {\n    enumerable: !(bitmap & 1),\n    configurable: !(bitmap & 2),\n    writable: !(bitmap & 4),\n    value: value\n  };\n};\n","var classof = require('../internals/classof-raw');\nvar global = require('../internals/global');\n\nmodule.exports = classof(global.process) == 'process';\n","module.exports = typeof window == 'object';\n","'use strict';\nvar DESCRIPTORS = require('../internals/descriptors');\nvar fails = require('../internals/fails');\nvar objectKeys = require('../internals/object-keys');\nvar getOwnPropertySymbolsModule = require('../internals/object-get-own-property-symbols');\nvar propertyIsEnumerableModule = require('../internals/object-property-is-enumerable');\nvar toObject = require('../internals/to-object');\nvar IndexedObject = require('../internals/indexed-object');\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-assign -- safe\nvar $assign = Object.assign;\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-defineproperty -- required for testing\nvar defineProperty = Object.defineProperty;\n\n// `Object.assign` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.assign\nmodule.exports = !$assign || fails(function () {\n  // should have correct order of operations (Edge bug)\n  if (DESCRIPTORS && $assign({ b: 1 }, $assign(defineProperty({}, 'a', {\n    enumerable: true,\n    get: function () {\n      defineProperty(this, 'b', {\n        value: 3,\n        enumerable: false\n      });\n    }\n  }), { b: 2 })).b !== 1) return true;\n  // should work with symbols and should have deterministic property order (V8 bug)\n  var A = {};\n  var B = {};\n  // eslint-disable-next-line es/no-symbol -- safe\n  var symbol = Symbol();\n  var alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrst';\n  A[symbol] = 7;\n  alphabet.split('').forEach(function (chr) { B[chr] = chr; });\n  return $assign({}, A)[symbol] != 7 || objectKeys($assign({}, B)).join('') != alphabet;\n}) ?
